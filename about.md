I earned my B.S. in applied mathematics from Cal Poly Pomona and my Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT under the supervision of Gigliola Staffilani. 
I'm a first-generation college student, and as an undergrad I participated in the [McNair Scholars Program](http://www.fullerton.edu/mcnair/), 
the [Math Alliance](https://www.mathalliance.org/), and the [MIT Summer Research Program](https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/). 
(I encourage students to check out all of them!). After receiving my doctorate, 
I stayed at MIT for an additional year as a Postdoctoral Associate in Digital Learning where I helped develop and facilitate 
Massive Open Online Courses through [MITx/edX](https://www.edx.org/school/mitx).

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer (midfield/striker), baking desserts, and reading fantasy novels (a favorite of mine being 
[The Stormlight Archive](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/the-stormlight-archive-series/) by Brandon Sanderson, and I'm currently 
making my way through [The Wheel of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) series by Robert Jordan).
I also play the flute in the [CSUF University Band](https://www.fullerton.edu/arts/music/students/ensembles/band.php), 
and perhaps most importantly, I have two cats (Cooper and Lucius).
