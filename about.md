  <p>
    I'm an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at California State University Fullerton (CSUF), a 2024-2026 MGB-SIAM Early Career Fellow, and a 2020 Project NExT Brown Dot.
    I earned my B.S. in applied mathematics from Cal Poly Pomona and my Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT under the supervision of Gigliola Staffilani.
    As a graduate student, I was an NSF Graudate Research Fellow, an MIT Dean of Science Fellow, and a 2019 MIT Graduate Woman of Excellence.
    I'm a first-generation college student, and as an undergrad I participated in the <a href="https://www.cpp.edu/mcnair/index.shtml">McNair Scholars Program</a>, 
    the <a href="https://www.mathalliance.org/">Math Alliance</a>, and the <a href="https://oge.mit.edu/graddiversity/msrp/">MIT Summer Research Program</a> 
    (I encourage students to check out all of them!). After receiving my doctorate, 
    I stayed at MIT for an additional year as a Postdoctoral Associate in Digital Learning where I helped develop and facilitate 
    Massive Open Online Courses through <a href="https://www.edx.org/school/mitx">MITx/edX</a>.

    In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer (midfield/striker), baking desserts, and reading fantasy novels (a favorite of mine being 
    The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson, and I'm currently making my way through The Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan).
    I also play the flute in the <a href="https://www.fullerton.edu/arts/music/students/ensembles/band.php">CSUF University Band</a>, 
    and perhaps most importantly, I have two cats (Lucius and Cooper).
