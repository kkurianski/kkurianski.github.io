# Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics

I am the faculty advisor for the SIAM Student Chapter at CSUF. The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) is a professional organization for applied mathematicians. SIAM publishes journals, hosts conferences, offers networking opportunities, and provides career and research resources for students. The existence of a SIAM Student Chapter allows all CSUF students to obtain a free SIAM Student Membership.
- Visit the [CSUF SIAM Student Chapter website](https://sites.google.com/fullerton.edu/csufsiamstudentchapter/home) to find out how you can get involved.
- Visit the [SIAM website](https://www.siam.org/) for details about the organization.

Please contact me if you have questions or want to learn more about the organization.
