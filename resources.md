<h2>CSUF SIAM Student Chapter</h2>

I am the faculty advisor for the SIAM Student Chapter at CSUF. The Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) is a professional organization for applied mathematicians. SIAM publishes journals, hosts conferences, offers networking opportunities, and provides career and research resources for students. The existence of a SIAM Student Chapter allows all CSUF students to obtain a free SIAM Student Membership.

<h2>Research, Academic, and Career Opportunities</h2>

I keep a running <strong><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1STAmEXSGrr9-8CtNvOTbPE25mmNWv_tvlxLXPAgKaDA/edit?usp=sharing">list of resources and opportunities</a></strong> that I have come across over the years. I try to keep this as up-to-date as possible, but some links may be old.
