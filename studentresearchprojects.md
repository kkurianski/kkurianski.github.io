  <p><strong>Investigating resource allocation for wildfire prevention using topological data analysis</strong><br />
    <em>Giovani Guitierrez, Graduate</em><br />
    <em>Enzo Mediana, Undergraduate</em><br />
    <em>Sophia Castro, Undergraduate</em><br />
    Spring 2025 - Summer 2025<br />
<p>Given the devastating effects of recent wildfires in Los Angeles County, we seek to apply principles from topological data analysis (TDA) to study resource allocation 
  and wildfire risk in Southern California. Our research questions are: (i) are fire prevention methods and wildfire resources equitably distributed?, 
  and (ii) are there significant differences in access to wildfire resources for populations of different vulnerability or demographics? 
  To answer these questions, we apply TDA concepts to datasets from CAL FIRE, OpenStreetMap, and the US Census Bureau.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Title 2</strong><br />
  Student 2 developed a mathematical model to study groundwater contamination and contributed to numerical simulations comparing cleanup strategies under different flow conditions.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Title 3</strong><br />
  Student 3 analyzed differential equation models of tumor growth, focusing on sensitivity to treatment timing and the effects of immune response on long-term dynamics.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Title 4</strong><br />
  Student 4 applied topological data analysis to categorize behavior in dynamical systems. Their work contributed new visual tools to distinguish between stable and chaotic dynamics.</p>

  <p><strong>Project Title 5</strong><br />
  Student 5 created interactive visualizations to support teaching linear algebra concepts. Their tools were implemented in a course pilot and are now being refined based on student feedback.</p>
