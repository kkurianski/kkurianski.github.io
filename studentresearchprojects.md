      <p>Given the devastating effects of recent wildfires in Los Angeles County, we seek to apply principles from topological 
        data analysis (TDA) to study resource allocation and wildfire risk in Southern California. Our research questions are:
        (i) are fire prevention methods and wildfire resources equitably distributed?, and (ii) are there significant differences
        in access to wildfire resources for populations of different vulnerability or demographics? To answer these questions, we 
        apply TDA concepts to datasets from CAL FIRE, OpenStreetMap, and the US Census Bureau.</p>

  <p><strong>A flow-kick model for tumor, immune, and normal cell interactions under drug treatment</strong><br />
    <em>Sasha Tafolla, Graduate</em><br />
    2025<br />
    <img src="/images/tumorflowkick_project.png" alt="Flow-kick model for tumor dynamics" style="float: left; max-height: 200px; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;" />
      <p>Our goal is to explore the combinations of strength and frequency of chemotherapy treatment
        that eliminate the tumor while preserving healthy levels of normal and immune cells.
        Starting with a scenario where tumor and normal cells would coexist in the absence of treatment,
        we compute the boundaries in the flow-kick parameter space that separate coexisting cell dynamics and the tumor-free state.</p>

  <p><strong>Chaotic dynamics in infectious disease model with changeable attitudes toward vaccination</strong><br />
    <em>Avery Brinkley, Underaduate</em><br />
    2024<br />

      <p>In recent outbreaks, vaccine hesitancy affected the control of disease spread as people's attitudes towards vaccination changed. We explore periodic and potentially chaotic dynamics of a system of differential equations modeling this phenomenon.</p>

  <p><strong>Exploring classical guitar playing techniques through signal processing</strong><br />
    <em>Victor Sanchez, Undergraduate</em><br />
    2020-2021<br />
    <img src="/images/guitar_project.png" alt="Classical guitar project" style="float: left; max-height: 200px; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;" />
      <p>We study the relationship between the plucking location along a guitar string and the strength of the harmonics in the resulting audio signal from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The audio signal produced by plucking an acoustic guitar string at various locations was analyzed using the discrete Fourier transform. We then compare the resulting experimental data to the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients predicted by a theoretical model based on the one-dimensional wave equation.</p>
